# 🏠 Boxing Matches Outcome Predictions

## 🎯 Problem Description

In boxing, promoters, gamblers, and fans make decisions without accurate predictions about who will win a fight. The lack of accurate winner predictions creates financial risks, uninformed bets, and limits marketing and training planning.

## 🔧 Proposed Solution

Development of a machine learning model that predicts the winer based on characteristics such as KO Rate, stance, age, wins and looses. The model achieves 90% accuracy on the test set.

## 📊 Principal Results

- F1 Score: 0.90
- Most important variables: Stance, looses, age, punch resistance.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.9+
- Pandas - Data wrangling
- Scikit-learn - Machine Learning
- Logistic Regression - Principal Model
- Matplotlib/Seaborn - Visualizations
- Jupyter - Interactive Analisis

## 📈 Methodology

1. Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers.
2. Feature engineering: Creating derived variables.
3. Modeling: Comparing multiple algorithms.
4. Validation: Cross-validation and evaluation metrics.
5. Machine Learning Explainability: Confusion matrix and logistic regression coefficient.

## 🔍 Conclusions and learnings

- Stance is the most important factor in price 43% importance).
- Linear models (Logistic Regression) significantly outperformed ensamble methods.
- Feature engineering improved performance by 7%.
- In dataframes that refer to multiple individuals in a single row, join them with the difference between them (feature engineering).
